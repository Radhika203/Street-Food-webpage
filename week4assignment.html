	<h2>Gourmet food is all formal,<br>Its the street food that makes you feel Indian!</h2>
	
	<p id="main">India lives and eats on its streets. And we owe a measure of gratitude to the people who feed us.
	When somebody mentions ‘street food’ in an Indian context, you immediately think chaat. And yes, chaat is India’s 
	most-famous street food; it is the symbol of the soul of our cities and in many of our metros and towns, it is the 
	signature food.
	What is Bombay without bhelpuri? The problem with this perception is that not all street food is chaat. Some of it is
	real food, solid hearty stuff that keeps labourers going through tough days. The reason we regard it as street food 
	is because it is usually sold (though not necessarily made) on the streets by people who can’t afford restaurant 
	rents to people who can’t pay restaurant prices. And most north Indian chaat is hard to find in the south,
	anyway.</p>

	<h3 class="head">Information in brief about some Street Foods:
	<h3>1.Vada Pav</h3>
	<img class="info" src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/af/f3/4f/aff34fd2c4c14d9b829fa3390531fd2f.jpg">
	<p>Of all Mumbai's street snacks, the vada pav has grown to be the darling of the masses.Vada pav is starch heaven
	,an instant energy booster.
	The humble vada pav: these deep-fried fiery balls of chickpea-battered mashed potatoes, laid inside a chutney 
	smothered pav are so delectable that they compel the perpetually in-a-hurry Mumbaikars to pause and grab one. 
	For a city known for its fast paced life, is it any surprise that Mumbai’s favorite snack is a grab-and-go 
	dish</p>
	<br><br>
	
	<h3>2.Puchka/Pani Puri</h3>
	<img class="data" src="https://imgstaticcontent.lbb.in/lbbnew/wp-content/uploads/sites/1/2017/07/13170510/130717_panipuri-generic.jpg">
	<p>panipuri has almost a dozen different names that changes from region to region like 
	panipuri, golgappa, phuchka or pani ke bataashe they’ve ever had. That’s the beauty behind the innocuous 
	deep fried snack – fill it up with goodies, and flavoured water, and it’s almost like a good addiction.
	In Kolkata, your immunity system is tested by how much phuchka you can eat at one stretch. The best 
	ones are often found on the roads, and people have their favourite destinations.</p>
	<br><br>
	
	<h3>3.Momos</h3>
	<img class="info" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/14/9b/94/149b94c31b1a489e842e6d3af90fc218.jpg">
	<p>A friend of mine had once said, “Nepalis don’t think. We just eat momos." And he wasn’t off the mark.
	Momos are ubiquitous in Nepal, and, thanks to the thousands of streetside vendors across north India, 
	are common in the Indian capital as well.From Darjeeling to Dharamshala, the momo is an essential street food.
	The many flavours and textures of a common dumpling—a small piece of rice dough filled with meat—excites the 
	gastronome.</p>
	<br><br>
	
	<h3>4.Dabeli</h3>
	<img class="data" src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/c4/6e/e3/c46ee3de117722f535d1eb290f76f243.jpg">
	<p>Big streets and narrow lanes were all paved with vendors selling Dabeli.Like so much Indian street food, 
	dabeli has that genius blend of softness and crunch, sweetness and salt. Each vendor insinuates his own
	special flavours into the dish, but by and large, a dabeli is made of buttered pao, grilled on a tawa, 
	split open and stuffed with a spiced potato mixture, onions, pomegranates and sweet- tangy- spicy chutneys.</p>
